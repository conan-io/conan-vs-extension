## This extension development and maintenance is "on hold" until Conan 2.0

**Sorry, we don't have the resources at this moment to maintain this extension.
There are some known issues, like this extension doesn't work with latest VS 2022.
We will resume work as soon as possible, but that means most likely after 2.0 GA.**

#### Build Status
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/8ddamkckmfgu618o/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ConanOrgCI/conan-vs-extension/branch/master)

conan-vs-extension
==================

An extension for Visual Studio 2017/2019 which automates the use of [the Conan C/C++ package manager](https://conan.io/) for retrieving dependencies within Visual Studio projects.  

Installation
------------
Use the Extension Manager inside Visual Studio, or visit
the [Visual Studio marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=conan-io.conan-vs-extension)
to download it.

Documentation
-------------

Visit the [documentation](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-vs-extension/tree/master/docs) for details
on how to use the Conan Extension for Visual Studio.


Extension Usage
-----------------------
Once the extension is installed, projects simply need to have a `conanfile.txt` or `conanfile.py` added to the solution.  Once one of these files has been added, the `conan-vs-extension` will download all the project dependencies, build them if necessary, and pass the resulting paths and flags to Visual Studio through a generated `.props` file. Furthermore, when changing the Visual Studio project `Configuration` (between `Release` or `Debug`) or `Platform` (between `x64` and `x86`/`Win32` ), the extension will re-run `Conan` automatically with these new settings and download or build the required binaries.  Crucially, after each run of a Conan operation, the extension will offer to refresh your Visual Studio project once the operation is complete.  This refresh will be necessary for intellisense apply all the new preprocessor defintions and flags, and to reflect all the new headers.  

Development and Testing
-----------------------  

#### Prerequisites

In order to be able to build extension from the source, you need Visual Studio 2017 or 2019 installed. All required components Visual Studio components are listed in the [.vsconfig](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/setup/configure-visual-studio-across-your-organization-with-vsconfig/#) file in the repository root. Just open the `Conan.VisualStudio.sln` solution, and IDE will display a prompt to install missing components:

![vsconfig](docs/images/vsconfig.png)

If you want to build the extension yourself and test it locally (perhaps because you are making changes for a PR), you can currently test the extension one of two ways:  Debug Mode and Local VSIX Installation.

#### Debug Mode  
Most likely, you should just run your changes in debug mode. Open the `Conan.VisualStudio.sln` file using the Visual Studio 2017 or 2019 and `Run` the project. It will create an isolated Visual Studio environment and load the extension.  
*Note: This can take up to a minute or two.*

#### Local VSIX Installation  
Alternatively, you may want to build the VSIX and share with a few other developers. In that case, just "Build" the `Release` configuration of project in Visual Studio. You can build from a Developer Command prompt with this command: 

	$ msbuild /p:Configuration=Release


It will output the `.vsix` file to:  

	Conan.VisualStudio\bin\Release\Conan.VisualStudio.vsix
	
From there, you can share and/or install the `.vsix` file as desired. Here is a decent [blog post about working with `.vsix` files manually](https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2016/Mar/01/Registering-and-Unregistering-a-VSIX-Extension-from-the-Command-Line#Installing)

#### Using the Extension with Changes
Once you have the Visual Studio environment with the modified extension loaded, or have installed the extension from the `.vsix` file, you can test it by opening one of the examples in the [`Conan.VisualStudio.Examples` directory](Conan.VisualStudio.Examples/):

----------------

This extension was started by community members like @sboullema, @SSE4, @ForNeVer and @solvingj, thanks to
them the first version of the extension was given birth and now [the Conan team is supporting it and pushing it
forward](https://blog.conan.io/2019/06/17/Conan-extension-for-Visual-Studio.html). We still receive very valuable
contributions from the community and we hope to continue to receive them.

Each version and the released features are summarized in the
[CHANGELOG file](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-vs-extension/tree/master/CHANGELOG.md). Feel free to
request new features and follow the evolution of incoming ones in the issues and pull requests of this repository.
